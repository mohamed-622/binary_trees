# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Overview

This repository contains the solutions for the 0x1D C - Binary trees project. The project is designed to provide an understanding of binary trees, their traversal methods, and various properties associated with them. The tasks involve implementing different functions related to binary trees, such as node insertion, traversal, size, height, balance factor, etc.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Explain the concept of a binary tree and differentiate between binary trees and binary search trees.
- Understand the traversal methods for binary trees (pre-order, in-order, post-order).
- Compute the size, height, and balance factor of a binary tree.
- Implement basic binary tree operations like node insertion.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- All files should end with a new line.
- Use the Betty style for code formatting. You can check your code using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- No global variables are allowed.
- Each C file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- The standard library can be used.
- The prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file `binary_trees.h`.
- All header files should be include guarded.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into multiple tasks, each targeting different aspects of binary trees:

- Task 0: Creating a binary tree node.
- Task 1: Inserting a node as the left-child of another node.
- Task 2: Inserting a node as the right-child of another node.
- Task 3: Deleting an entire binary tree.
- Task 4: Checking if a node is a leaf.
- Task 5: Checking if a node is a root.
- Task 6: Pre-order traversal of a binary tree.
- Task 7: In-order traversal of a binary tree.
- Task 8: Post-order traversal of a binary tree.
- Task 9: Measuring the height of a binary tree.
- Task 10: Measuring the depth of a node in a binary tree.
- Task 11: Measuring the size of a binary tree.
- Task 12: Counting the leaves in a binary tree.
- Task 13: Counting the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree.
- Task 14: Measuring the balance factor of a binary tree.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the task-specific directory you want to check.
3. Compile the source files using the provided compilation command.
4. Run the compiled executable to test the implementation.
5. Check the correctness of your solution and its output.
